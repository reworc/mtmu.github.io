  Elastic displays empower users to interact naturally through push- ing and
  pulling, folding and twisting. While this kind of interaction is not as
  precise as on other devices, it utilizes interaction metaphors which are easy
  to learn and understand. We present a system that uses physically based
  interaction and visualization metaphors to gain a deeper comprehension of the
  underlying data and its structure. By applying pressure on specific interface
  elements, associated items are attracted and repelled, the exerted force on
  the items itself translates into a semantic zoom behavior to display more
  in-depth information about the specific entity. We present the core concepts
  of the system, explain the decisions made during the design process and
  discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed system as well as a
  short view on further improvements and open research questions.
