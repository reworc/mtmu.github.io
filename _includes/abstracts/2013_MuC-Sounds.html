  In this article the idea of music composing with an elastic tabletop including
  tangible objects embedded into its surface is described. An elastic display
  dynamically creates several physical shapes representing different music
  samples for interaction. The shapes can be activated and manipulated by the
  user to arrange the associated samples. The key benefits of this form of
  interaction are the intuitive use, the ability to playfully explore music and
  the expressiveness of the physical representation of sound.
