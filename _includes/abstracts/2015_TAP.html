  In virtual environments, perceived distances are frequently reported to be
  shorter than intended. One important parameter for spatial perception in a
  stereoscopic virtual environment is the stereo base—that is, the distance
  between the two viewing cameras. We systematically varied the stereo base
  relative to the interpupillary distance (IPD) and examined influences on
  distance and size perception. Furthermore, we tested whether an individual
  adjustment of the stereo base through an alignment task would reduce the
  errors in distance estimation. Participants performed reaching movements
  toward a virtual tennis ball either with closed eyes (blind reaches) or open
  eyes (sighted reaches). Using the participants’ individual IPD, the stereo
  base was set to (a) the IPD, (b) proportionally smaller, (c) proportionally
  larger, or (d) adjusted according to the individual performance in an
  alignment task that was conducted beforehand. Overall, consistent with
  previous research, distances were underestimated. As expected, with a smaller
  stereo base, the virtual object was perceived as being farther away and
  bigger, in contrast to a larger stereo base, where the virtual object was
  perceived to be nearer and smaller. However, the manipulation of the stereo
  base influenced blind reaching estimates to a smaller extent than expected,
  which might be due to a combination of binocular disparity and pictorial depth
  cues. In sighted reaching, when visual feedback was available, presumably the
  use of disparity matching led to a larger effect of the stereo base. The use
  of an individually adjusted stereo base diminished the average underestimation
  but did not reduce interindividual variance. Interindividual differences were
  task specific and could not be explained through differences in stereo acuity
  or fixation disparity.
