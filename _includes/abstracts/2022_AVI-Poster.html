    Creating innovative applications for novel interface technologies
    poses several challenges for both designers and developers. Rapid
    prototyping helps to examine concepts, check hypotheses, and
    acquire early user feedback. In this paper, we present ReFlex, a
    framework that provides rapid prototyping and development tools
    for Elastic Displays, and its application in the context of a student
    project developing a spatial controller for remote 3D navigation.
