    Elastic Displays are shape-changing interfaces, typically made from elastic fabric. 
    Surface deformation creates an additional dimension of interaction and enhances the 
    haptic experience for the user compared to rigid touch interfaces. Other forms of shape-changing
    interfaces such as actuated displays introduce significant mechanical complexity 
    with the benefit of providing active haptic feedback and self-deformation.
    We investigate ways to make Elastic Displays more 'active' while maintaining their simple setup. 
    Our approach adds vibrotactile feedback to the elastic surface, which add explicit 
    haptic feedback when pushing and pulling the surface.

    In this contribution, we describe the technical setup and introduce concepts 
    for exploring this active haptic feedback. We realized a case study, in which 
    a layered information space is explored. Finally, we report
    lessons learned from user feedback, showing that solely vibrotactile feedback 
    may have distracting effects on the user, but in combination with visual feedback 
    can improve the user experience.
