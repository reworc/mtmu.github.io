    Any design endeavor requires practitioners to engage in divergent
    thinking. Numerous creativity techniques and methods exist to support 
    the design process and give structure in order to converge a wide 
    variety of ideas into suitable candidates for prototyping and testing. 
    Designing for specific, tangible interaction technologies requires a 
    careful framing of the selected methods.

    Over the course of 10 years, our research group has gained experience
    in designing and developing applications for elastic displays.
    In this pictorial paper, we illustrate methods and intermediate
    results for a concrete application design. Due to the Covid19
    pandemic, we made extensive use of the collaborative whiteboard
    application miro. We designed a way to visualize, explore, and evaluate
    clustering algorithms in the domain of machine learning using
    an elastic display. Finally, we present follow-up techniques for
    prototyping the concepts and ideas.
