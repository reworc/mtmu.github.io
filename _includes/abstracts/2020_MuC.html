    Tangible Interaction in collaborative scenarios represents a natural and 
    intuitive way to explore and discuss complex issues in a playful way, 
    supporting communication, negotiation and teamwork. 
    We present a concept for Elastic Displays to support decision-making processes 
    in the context of civil engineering construction planning, 
    related to the research context of Building Information modelling techniques. 
    This involves the exploration of spatial issues, as well as identifying 
    changes to the project schedule and cost plan.

    We use the power of Elastic Displays to quickly explore semantic and time layers
    in complex maps and use them in conjunction with an integrated overview 
    of the project timeline and cost overview. 
    Furthermore, we discuss some gestures used for interacting with the 
    Zoomable User Interface and navigate Layered Visualizations with magic lenses. 
    Finally, we discuss our findings from the implemented prototype and 
    share some thoughts on future work for Zoomable UIs on Elastic Displays.
