    Elastic displays afford a natural stacking of information layers
    in their haptic interaction space. So far, research has focused on
    technical issues and interaction concepts by pushing and pulling the
    surface of such displays.

    We report a study with 24 participants that investigates the 
    feasibility and limitations of interaction with 6 to 21
    layers. We measured completion times and error rates for reaching
    and holding specific target layers and observed performed gestures.
    Our findings show that solution time increases with more layers
    while precision is maintained with a mean success rate of holding
    a layer of 70 %, even when using up to 21 layers. User experience
    measurements show that hedonic qualities of the interaction were
    rated higher than pragmatic qualities.

    Our investigation proves the general feasibility of using 
    layer-based interaction with an elastic display and 
    provides guidelines on the limitations.
