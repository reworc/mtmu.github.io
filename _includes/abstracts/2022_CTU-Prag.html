    Elastic Displays as a specific type of Shape-Changing
    Interfaces provide haptic feedback by using the deformation of the
    screen for interaction. There have been several prototypes showcasing
    different use cases, visualization techniques and interaction metaphors.

    In this paper, we present an overview over our efforts to create a modular
    and extendable software framework to support research in the context
    of this specific type of interface. The main goal is to provide a
    common and easy starting point to streamline research on this technology.

    The ReFlex framework is based on a service-oriented client-server
    architecture and uses modern web technologies for platform-independent
    development. Furthermore, it provides tools for configuration
    and calibration to simplify the hardware setup. Development
    tools as well as plugins and templates for common client technologies
    provide a starting point for rapid prototyping concepts for Elastic Displays.

    Finally, we provide insights on our experiences with framework
    as part of student projects and describe our ideas for future research
    on possible framework extensions and technological enhancements in the
    context of Elastic Displays.
