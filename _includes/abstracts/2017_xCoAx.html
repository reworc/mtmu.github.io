    In this paper, we present an interaction and visualization
    concept for elastic displays. The interaction
    concept was inspired by the search process of a
    rummage table to explore a large set of product
    data. The basic approach uses a similarity-based
    search pattern â€” based on a small set of items, the
    user refines the search result by examining similar
    items and exchanging them with items from the
    current result. A physically-based approach is used
    to interact with the data by deforming the surface
    of the elastic display. The presented visualization
    concept uses glyphs to directly compare items at a
    glance. Zoomable UI techniques controlled by the
    deformation of the elastic surface allow to display
    different levels of detail for each item.
