  By their deformable screen-materials elastic displays and projection screens
  provide physical three- dimensional interaction modalities like push, pull or
  bend. Compared with conventional Multi-Touch displays they offer an additional
  interaction dimension which can be used to explore data. In this article we
  describe the FlexiWall, a large elastic display, and several example
  applications using layered data sets. The exploration of several layers and
  correlations between these is not common to traditional user interfaces, where
  the interaction is often constrained to two dimensions. Therefore, new forms
  of interaction are introduced. We furthermore propose additional techniques
  and tools to explore layered data sets, e.g. utilizing transparent objects
  when interacting with elastic displays.
