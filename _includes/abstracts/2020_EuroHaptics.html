    Shape-changing interfaces are addressed by the research community
    with more scientific vigor in recent years. Elastic displays afford
    novel ways to interact with data and have also been investigated for
    almost a decade now. Our goal is to move this interaction technology 
    out of its experimental stage and into more sophisticated real-world scenarios.

    In this work-in-progress paper, we describe our research agenda
    and preliminary results. On the one hand, we aim to consolidate and
    extend fundamental knowledge about the interaction and visualization
    techniques that are suitable and effective for elastic displays. Our main
    goals in this respect are the development and evaluation of a gesture language
    and the introduction of an online knowledge base. On the other
    hand, we investigate specific use cases that leverage the unique properties
    of elastic displays. For this leg of our research, we carry out a long-term
    observation of a museum installation of an elastic display and devise new
    applications in a research project with industrial partners.
