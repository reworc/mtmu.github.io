  Elastic displays offer new ways to interact with multi-dimensional data by
  using the deformation of the surface as a tool to explore, filter, structure,
  or manipulate data. While a large number of prototypes exist, a general
  concept for using this promising technology in real-world application domains
  has not been established. In this paper, we introduce a framework about
  elastic displays and their applications with reference to the interaction
  techniques they provide. We investigate the data applicable to elastic
  displays and the appropriate interaction techniques. Using this approach, it
  is possible to identify strengths and weaknesses of this technology regarding
  specific scenarios, to find commonalities to traditional user interfaces and
  to explore novel concepts for interaction.
